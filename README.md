## Requirements

The version numbers in brackets indicate the tested versions but feel free to use more recent versions.
You can also use alternative tools if you know how to configure them (e.g., Firefox instead of Chrome).

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (v2) => [installation instructions](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)
  * [Add your Git username and set your email](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html#add-your-git-username-and-set-your-email)
    * `git config --global user.name "YOUR_USERNAME"` => check `git config --global user.name`
    * `git config --global user.email "email@example.com"` => check `git config --global user.email`
  * > **Windows users**: We recommend to use the [Git Bash](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash) shell from your Git installation or the Bash shell from the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to run all shell commands for this project.
* [Chalmers GitLab](https://git.ita.chalmers.se/) => Login with your **Chalmers CID** choosing "Sign in with" **Chalmers Login**. (contact [support@chalmers.se](mailto:support@chalmers.se) if you don't have one)
  * DIT341 course group: https://git.ita.chalmers.se/courses/dit341
  * [Setup SSH key with Gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/)
    * Create an SSH key pair `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email@example.com"` (skip if you already have one)
    * Add your public SSH key to your Gitlab profile under https://git.ita.chalmers.se/profile/keys
    * Make sure the email you use to commit is registered under https://git.ita.chalmers.se/profile/emails
  * Checkout the [Backend-Frontend](https://git.ita.chalmers.se/courses/dit341/group-00-web) template `git clone git@git.ita.chalmers.se:courses/dit341/group-00-web.git`
* [Server Requirements](./server/README.md#Requirements)
* [Client Requirements](./client/README.md#Requirements)

## Getting started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@git.ita.chalmers.se:courses/dit341/group-00-web.git

# Change into the directory
cd group-00-web

# Setup backend
cd server && npm install
npm run dev

# Setup frontend
cd client && npm install
npm run serve
```

> Check out the detailed instructions for [backend](./server/README.md) and [frontend](./client/README.md).

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Open the `server` and `client` in separate VSCode workspaces or open the combined [backend-frontend.code-workspace](./backend-frontend.code-workspace). Otherwise, workspace-specific settings don't work properly.

## System Definition (MS0)

### Purpose

The purpose of the system is to store and manage login information for its users through a user friendly interface. Each user will need to provide their individual master login to access the system and everytime the user wants to access their password they will need to enter a locally stored pincode.

The main problem the system will strive to solve is to track your passwords making it easier to gain access to them. The system will store the content and data locally to ensure no leakage to the internet(like how draw.io uses tools online while having the option to store the data locally).

### Pages

* Main menu - Once logged in, the user will be able to see each account login as an individual entry in the system. Users can freely create, read, update, or delete entries at their own discretion.
* Entry pop up - Each entry can contain varying types of information in varying amounts (one website might require you to input your username rather than your email address and another might require 3 credentials (i.e username, password, and pincode) rather than the typical 2, ). Every entry will also require an associated url for sorting purposes.
* Categories/Sorting Folders - Entries will be sorted based on the associated website/service as well as categories the user can add (similar to category search in online stores). This can also be thought of as folders (E.g. one folder named “mail” for gmail or yahoo type of accounts and another folder named “shopping” for amazon & ebay).
